# Tasks

Welcome to the Forwards task repository! We will use the issues here to keep track of what each team is doing and identify where help is 
needed. Comments and offers to help are welcome from anyone in the R community!

## Initial Setup

We are hold an asynchronous workshop May 26 - June 30 to transfer existing tasks and gather ideas for new tasks. Anyone interested is 
welcome to contribute.

### Phase 1 (May 26 - Jun 1)

For each team we will collect ideas for projects, tasks, goals from all participants as GitHub issues
 - tag issues by relevant team(s) (see Forwards [About](https://forwards.github.io/about/) page for teams)
 - team members should include existing tasks, so we can see existing commitments and prioritise tasks 
    - add a milestone for existing tasks, e.g. expected month of completion for one-off tasks; or "on-going" for tasks such as liaison 
    with RUGs or writing up minutes from meetings.
    - tasks completed during the workshop should be closed
 
### Phase 2: (Jun 2 - Jun 8)

Add clarifications, questions and answers on collected ideas
 - comment on each others' issues
 
### Phase 3: (Jun 9 - Jun 15)

Each participant hearts 2 issues per team that they think we should prioritise
 - tasks with milestones can be ignored as already under-way
 
### Phase 4: (Jun 16 - Jun 23)

We sort ideas and tasks by hearts per team, core team meet to prioritise tasks. 

Team leaders 
 - add milestones to tasks that we will start on right away
 - add "help wanted" and (if appropriate) "good first issue" labels to new tasks, or existing tasks where more help is needed

Taskforce members
 - assign themselves to issues where help is needed
   - delete "help wanted" if you can do it by yourself, otherwise keep "help wanted" tag, perhaps adding comment on the type of help 
   required (e.g. more people to help with task directly or someone to mentor you doing task)
   
Non-taskforce members
 - let us know in the comments if you can hep with a specific issue (one-off help), or would like to join a team (commit beyond 
 one-off task)!
 
## Ongoing work

After the initial effort to set up tasks, we will need to maintain the task lists (issues) for each team. Please see 
[taskforce roles](taskforce_roles.md) for the responsibilities of team leaders and team members in how we plan to do this. Let the core 
team know (via slack/rowforwards@gmail.com) if you would like to change your role.
