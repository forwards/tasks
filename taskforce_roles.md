# Roles, Communications & Agreements

Everyone on the Forwards taskforce is volunteer, with limited time to commit to progressing the work of the taskforce. This guide to 
intended to make the most of that time, by clarifying how we will distribute and manage tasks.

Current team members and team leads are listed on [About](https://forwards.github.io/about/).

## Roles

### Team Leads (min 2 per team)

* Own the team’s task list
    * Add tasks
    * Groom tasks added by others
    * Prioritise tasks
* Support Task Owners with scoping, resources, advice
* Participate in core meetings to deliver progress updates and gather input
    * If no Team Lead is able to attend, add update to Slack/Etherpad 
* Facilitate virtual stand ups ~1 week prior to core team meeting and during slackathon 

### Task Owner

* Pick task to progress or deliver by next month
    * If you are a team member, give priority to your team tasks, but feel free to assign yourself to help with another team's task.
* Scope deliverable
* Set deadline (can be more than a month)
* Participate in virtual stand up meetings to keep lead and team up-to-date
* Deliver task
    * Submit PR if code related
    * Comment progress on git issue if it’s not a code task, e.g. community tasks
    
## Meetings

### Core meeting

* Core team discusses progress on previous tasks, new tasks and task lists as needed

### Virtual Stand Up

1 week prior to the Core meeting/during the slackathon teams will conduct a virtual asynchronous stand up to update on progress, 
delays, scope changes, deliverables, requirements and so on.
* The current taskforce administrator will send an email reminder for the virtual stand up before the core team meeting and a calendar 
invite to the slackathon.
* Team Leads will review the task list, note tasks that need attention, ask for updates from Task Owners
* Task Owners will send updates to the relevant Team Leads for their tasks
    * e.g. progress/delays on existing task, taking ownership of a task in the task list, adding tasks to the task list
* Team Leads and Owners will follow up with questions/clarifications as needed

## Communication channels

* Teleconference (set up by current administrator) for core team meetings
* Slack for regular stand up and team meetings 
   * all team members are added to Slack and should use the most relevant team channel to discuss tasks
   * if you cannot use Slack, or are an outside collaborator, use GitHub or email to communicate updates
* GitHub for task list and deliverables 
   * contribute to task list via issues on forwards/tasks
   * contribute to tasks via PR or comment to repo relevant to task
   * potentially manage all GitHub for a team via [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/forwards/projects)
* [Slack + GitHub](https://slack.github.com)

## Agreements

* All participants (in teams and across teams) will make an effort 
    * to communicate efficiently
    * to reduce meeting times or avoid them entirely
    * to avoid chasing or waiting for each other for updates
    * to use asynchronous communication as much as possible to support cross-time zones communication
    * to make it easy for new contributors to take part
* Task Owners working on tasks with a milestone date will update on their tasks even if they don't make any progress
    * we all have other commitments, but the Team Leads should know what’s moving and what’s delayed or blocked or needs to change hands
    * if a Task Owner doesn’t provide an update by/during the virtual stand up, it will be assumed the task is up-for-grabs again for 
    anyone who is available to contribute 
* Task Owners working on ongoing tasks will update the Team Leads/core team if they are no longer able to work on the task.
* The Task Owners and Team Leads are free to schedule updates, syncs and follow ups as needed, in case the virtual stand up time 
isn’t convenient for them or they prefer another way to evaluate progress.
* Task lists will be on GitHub for visibility and easy access for new contributors
